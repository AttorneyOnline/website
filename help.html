                <h2>Welcome to Attorney Online!</h2>
                <p>
                     It looks like you may be new to Attorney Online, or at least need a refresher on how it all works. That's A-okay! I’m the
                    Tutorial, or Tutorial Ema, and I’ll be your teacher to the basics of Attorney Online, or AO for short. This tutorial serves
                    as a basic introduction to the AO2 client's user interface, which may seem rather haphazard to unfamiliar players.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's begin!
                </p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <div class="col-lg-12 helpcontainer">
                <h2>The Client</h2>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="images/help3.png">
                <p>
                    This will be the first thing you see once you choose a server and then a character. This window is known as the “client”.
                    Everything located here are the tools you’ll need to chat, defend, prosecute, and ultimately do anything inside AO. Let’s
                    go over everything located in this window.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h2>In-Character</h2>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="images/help5.png" usemap="#ic-map">
                <map name="ic-map">
                    <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,256,192" href="#ic-1">
                    <area shape="rect" coords="0,192,256,214" href="#ic-2">
                    <area shape="rect" coords="0,214,256,320" href="#ic-3">
                    <area shape="rect" coords="256,0,491,320" href="#ic-4">
                </map>
                <p>
                    This is the “in-character” screen. In here, you’ll see the actual characters come to life, and
                    this is where you’ll do most of the talking on AO. There are a few key points in the in-character display:
                    <h3 id="ic-1"><span class="help-item-number">1</span>Viewport</h3>
                    <p>
                        The viewport is where you’ll see the sprite, background, name, and text of other players or yourself. One message will appear
                        after another, which are automatically recorded on the IC log.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="ic-2"><span class="help-item-number">2</span>Text Line</h3>
                    <p>
                        This thin empty gray line between your buttons and display screen is the IC text line. Click here to actually type out
                        your message. Once you press Enter, it will appear on the display screen for everyone to see.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note, however, that the text box only clears when the message is successfully sent. If there are other players currently talking,
                        you'll have to wait before you can press Enter to successfully send a message.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="ic-3"><span class="help-item-number">3</span>Emotion Buttons</h3>
                    <p>
                        This rectangle full of faces are the emote buttons. Each button selects a different set of sprites that will correspond
                        to the message you type in. Click on one of these buttons to use the emote.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some emotes include a <em>preanimation</em>, which is played before your character begins talking. Clicking on the emote
                        twice toggles the preanimation. The toggle state of the preanimation is displayed on the "Pre" checkbox.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="ic-4"><span class="help-item-number">4</span>Chat Log</h3>
                    <p>
                        This wall of text is called the Chat History. Here is where all past messages end up after they are displayed on the viewport.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the original Attorney Online (1.7.5 and earlier), it was not possible to scroll through the log.
                        Before 2.4.10, the log was ordered from newest to oldest, with new messages at the top. Since 2.4.10, the log order has been
                        reversed from oldest to newest, with new messages at the bottom.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    This section of your client has all of the buttons and settings you need to further enrich your AO experience.
                    <h3 id="opts-1"><span class="help-item-number">1</span>Interjections</h3>
                    <p>
                         If you are a fan of Ace Attorney, you know full well what the interjections mean. These three buttons add a condition on
                        top of your next typed out message that plays the famous “Hold it, Objection, Take That!” pop-ups before displaying your
                        message. Characters with voice lines will also play their voice lines on the interjection. Press one of the buttons to toggle
                        it on, and again to toggle it back off. The button automatically turns itself off after being used once to avoid spam.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="opts-2"><span class="help-item-number">2</span>Emotes, Pre/Flip Checks</h3>
                    <p>
                         The drop down menu marked “Normal” is your emote drop down menu. This drop down menu has all of your emotes listed
                        in word form. If you do not want to press the button on the IC menu, you can use this drop down menu instead. It changes
                        automatically to the currently selected emote as you press its corresponding button.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Next are the “Pre” and “Flip” check boxes. Every emote has three stages of animation: a pre-animation played before talking
                        (such as desk slam, damage or pointing), a talking animation, and a idle animation. If you check “pre”, it will play the
                        currently selected emote’s pre-animation, if any exists for the emote. Leaving it unchecked skips the emote's pre-animation.
                        Double clicking an emote button will automatically check your sprites "pre" animation. “Flip” will flip your sprite horizontally
                        like a mirror. This is useful if you wish to place a defense in the prosecutor's bench or vice versa.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="opts-3"><span class="help-item-number">3</span>Change Character, Reload Theme, Call Mod</h3>
                    <p>
                         "Change character" will bring you back to the character selection screen, which will allow you to switch characters or leave
                        the server. "Reload theme" is used when you change your theme or character INIs, but these will not be covered in this guide.
                        Pressing the "Call mod" button will send a request to all online moderators. Press it when you are having issues with trolls
                        or people breaking rules, or when you need a moderator.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="opts-4"><span class="help-item-number">4</span>Flash, Mute, Evidence, Color</h3>
                    <p>
                         The “!” button is the flash button. Pressing it and sending a message will flash the viewport and play a sound effect for
                        emphasis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         The mute button will allow you to mute a character. If a character is annoying you and no mods are nearby, you can use it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Tip:</strong> During a case, you can mute all unrelated characters, so you can play the case without interruptions. The evidence
                        button will switch you to the evidence GUI. There, you can edit, see and present evidence, depending on the server you are.
                        Note that not every server supports this, and evidence is usually handled using a Google Docs link. The color button allows
                        you to change the color of the text you use.
                    </p>

                        <li>Red: used on AA for emphasis on words or terms, but on AO it is not used too much, mainly for expressing anger. In some
                            servers, it is a mod-only color.</li>
                        <li>Orange: testimony titles</li>

                    <p>
                         These health bars are used during cases for penalties (known in the AA universe as Confidence Gauges). Any character seated
                        in the judge's bench can control the health bar.

                         These volume bars can be used to control the volume separately for background music, sound effects, and blips. You can use
                        the scroll wheel to change the volume.

                <h2>History and OOC</h2>
                <p>
                     This separate chat box to the top right of your client is known as the <em>out-of-character chat</em> (OOC). This is a handy tool
                    to communicate with other players while a case is underway, as well for typing out server commands.
                    <h3 id="ooc-1"><span class="help-item-number">1</span>Chat History/Display</h3>
                    <p>
                         This large scrollable grey box is the OOC chat display. Here is where you’ll see any OOC message inside your message, or
                        other useful information from the MOTD, to the area listing. Messages are ordered from oldest to newest.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="ooc-2"><span class="help-item-number">2</span>OOC Chat Bar</h3>
                    <p>
                         This long, dark gray bar is the OOC text box. You type both messages and commands here. When
                        first joining a server, it is a good habit to use this before the IC chat, lest you risk interrupting a case.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="ooc-3"><span class="help-item-number">3</span>OOC Username Box</h3>

                         This smaller dark grey box is where you input your username. You cannot use the OOC chat if you do not have a username set.
                        Before a name is entered, it will display a light grey colored font word saying “name.”

                    <p>
                         This button, set by default to “Server,” switches the chat log from server-side OOC chat to the master server chat, which
                        is viewable across all servers, as a sort of global chat. When in Server chat, it’ll display “Server”, and when in Master
                        chat, it’ll display “Master”.

                     The last major section of your client will be located to the bottom right of the window. This bright looking menu is known
                    as the “Music List”. Here is where you select your Ace Attorney music to play during trials, to better immerse yourself into
                    the case. Tracks highlighted in Green indicates that you have the song, while red tracks indicate that you do not have the
                    song, or it is not song related (e.g. areas or track categories).

                    <p>
                         With the introduction of the tsuserver3 server software, the first few lines are reserved for areas rather than tracks.
                        Simply double-click on one of these to move to that area.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="music-2"><span class="help-item-number">2</span>Music List</h3>
                    <p>
                         Under the area shortcuts is the actual music list. The music is separated by “=== ===” category headers. Tracks from
                        preludes, objection themes, and pursuit themes will be located in their respective categories. Double-click on one of the
                        entries to play the song, or double-click on the category header to stop the music.
